|Binary Tree|Normal binary search tree. Generation of random elements, adding, removing elements. Breadth first search for numbers in a range.|[Click](https://github.com/INLAE/java_education/tree/master/Algorithm/binaryTree/src)|
|Queue and Stack|Resizable. Pop, push etc|[Click](https://github.com/INLAE/java_education/tree/master/Algorithm/queueStack/src/ivanushkin)|
|Hash Function|Normal Dictionary. Collision resolution: in separate chaining, the process involves building a linked list with keyâ€“value pair for each search array index.|[Click](https://github.com/INLAE/java_education/tree/master/Algorithm/hashFunction/src)|
|Backtracking approach|The backtracking algorithm enumerates a set of partial candidates that, in principle, could be completed in various ways to give all the possible solutions to the given problem. The completion is done incrementally, by a sequence of candidate extension steps.|[Click](https://github.com/INLAE/java_education/tree/master/Algorithm/backtracking)|
|Dynamic Programming approach|Dynamic programming is used where we have problems, which can be divided into similar sub-problems, so that their results can be re-used.|[Click](https://github.com/INLAE/java_education/tree/master/Algorithm/tortilla)|
